This prover is still in development and may contain bugs. It is not intended to be used in production yet. We're a few weeks away to have it ready.
We expect to have something working in a good state by mid August 2023.

## Main building blocks

- [STARKS](https://github.com/lambdaclass/lambdaworks_cairo_prover/tree/main/src/starks): Everything related to STARKs building blocks such as the prover, verifier and FRI.
- [Cairo](https://github.com/lambdaclass/lambdaworks_cairo_prover/tree/main/src/cairo): Implementation of the Cairo AIR.

To be added:

- Grinding ✔️
- Skipping FRI layers
- Optimizing verifier operations
- Range-check ✔️ and Pedersen built-ins
- Different layouts

## Requirements

- Cargo 1.69+
  
## How to try it

For the moment, only programs in Cairo 0 with no arguments and contracts in Cairo 1 with no arguments are supported.

### Prove and verify

To prove Cairo programs you can use:

```bash
make prove PROGRAM_PATH=<compiled_program_path> PROOF_PATH=<output_proof_path>
```

To verify a proof you can use:
  
```bash
make verify PROOF_PATH=<proof_path>
```

For example:

```bash
make prove PROGRAM_PATH=fibonacci.json PROOF_PATH=fibonacci_proof
make verify PROOF_PATH=fibonacci_proof
```

To prove and verify with a single command you can use:

```bash
make run_all PROGRAM_PATH=<proof_path>
```


### Using Docker compiler for Cairo 0 programs

Build the compiler image with:

```bash
make docker_build_cairo_compiler
```

Then for example, if you have a Cairo program in the project folder, you can use:

```bash
make docker_compile_and_run_all PROGRAM=program_name.cairo
```

Or

```bash
make docker_compile_and_prove PROGRAM=program_name.cairo PROOF_PATH=proof_path
```

### Using cairo-compile for Cairo 0 programs

If you have `cairo-lang` installed, you can use it instead of the Dockerfile

Then for example, if you have some Cairo program in the project folder, you can use:

```bash
make compile_and_run_all PROGRAM=program_name.cairo
```

Or 

```bash
make compile_and_prove PROGRAM=program_name.cairo PROOF_PATH=proof_path
```

### Compiling Cairo 1 contracts

Clone `cairo` repository:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo
```

Checkout version 1.1.0 (corresponding to that tag of the repository). In the `cairo` folder, run:

``` bash
git checkout v1.1.0
```

- To create json file from Cairo contract:

  ``` bash
  cargo run --bin starknet-compile -- /path/to/input.cairo /path/to/output.json
  ```

- To create casm file from json file:

  ``` bash
  cargo run --bin starknet-sierra-compile -- /path/to/input.json /path/to/output.casm
  ```

## Running tests
To run tests, simply use
```
make test
```
If you have the `cairo-lang` toolchain installed, this will compile the Cairo programs needed
for tests.
If you have built the cairo-compile docker image, that will be used for compiling instead.

Be sure to build the docker image if you don't want to install the `cairo-lang` toolchain:
```
make docker_build_cairo_compiler
```

## Running fuzzers
To run a fuzzer, simply use 

```
make fuzzer <name of the fuzzer>
```

if you don´t have the tools for fuzzing installed use

```
make fuzzer_tools
```
